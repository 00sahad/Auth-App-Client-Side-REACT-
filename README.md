Greetings! 

I developed an authentication application using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This application allows users to securely register, login, and manage their accounts, with encrypted password storage and access control. The frontend is built with React and the backend uses Express for API endpoints and MongoDB for database storage. Additional features include password reset functionality, OTP verification, login with google and others. Overall, this application provides a robust and secure authentication system for modern web applications.
